### Play in your browser

> Note: We *very strongly* recommend running a native build for stability and performance. 

For the easiest set up, you need to use Google Chrome.

#### For technical users

To run the web build, you will need to enable WebGPU support. To do this, use a Chromium browser (Google Chrome, Vivaldi, Edge, Opera), and enter the following in your URL field:

`chrome://flags/#enable-unsafe-webgpu`

Enable the option, and load this page again. If you are on Linux, you will need to start Chrome with `--enable-features=Vulkan`. Alternatively, use a nightly version of Firefox, which has WebGPU enabled by default.

### Play on Windows, Mac, or Linux

Binaries are provided for Windows, Mac, and Linux. 

For Mac, an extra step is required. The application will be blocked from launch on first startup. Do this once, and close out the error menu. Then, search "Privacy & Security" in your settings. Scroll down until you see the blocked application and a prompt to open it anyways.
